      <h1>Your Favourite Paintings by Henri Rousseau!</h1>
      <p>Best known for his jungle paintings, <dfn>Henri Rousseau</dfn> (1844 – 1910) was very much an outsider in the art world. He was a self-taught artist, and didn’t paint in the traditional academic style of the Salon and French Academy. Rather, his artwork expressed an untrained style, featuring bold colours and flat figures. This style became known as “naïve” or “primitive”, and although it was often ridiculed by the artistic establishment, it was later embraced by avant-garde artists such as Pablo Picasso and Robert Delaunay.</p>

        <p>I love this one! As Henri Rousseau never travelled to the jungle, the plants depicted were inspired chiefly by his frequent visits to the Botanical Gardens in Paris and domestic house plants, whilst his tiger was potentially inspired by the zoo in the Gardens, as well as its Zoology Galleries, which exhibited stuffed animals.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>In this painting, Rousseau’s naïve style is evident with the flattened forms, the childish depiction of the woman’s face and the almost cartoonish eye of the lion, with its clearly distinguishable pupil and sclera (the white part of the eye).
        The painting appears in an episode of The Simpsons called “Mom and Pop Art”, when Homer falls asleep and is transported in a dream to the scene depicted in The Sleeping Gypsy.</p>

        <h2>The Snake Charmer</h2>

        </figure>
        
        <p>A female snake charmer is depicted in a jungle location, yet the painting seems much more otherworldly than most of Rousseau’s other jungle themed works. In fact, the Musée d’Orsay described the scene as a “disquieting Garden of Eden”.
        Due to its dreamlike qualities – with the moon providing backlight, the fantastical vegetation, and the use of bright, bold colours – the painting anticipates surrealism, which took off in the 1920s. In particular, the colours are similar to those later used by surrealist artist René Magritte.
        Along with its colours, the asymmetrical composition of The Snake Charmer highlights Rousseau’s “amateurish” technique.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>With its absurd scene – a woman lying on a sofa in the jungle – and its exploration of dreaming, Le Rêve is another example of Henri Rousseau anticipating surrealism. The woman depicted is Yadwigha (Jadwiga), Rousseau’s Polish mistress from his younger years. Looking closely at the painting, one can also see a native musician playing the flute in a colourful striped skirt, as well as a lion, a lioness, some birds, some monkeys, a snake, and an elephant.

        Although his naïve style is retained, Rousseau’s use of the reclining female nude is reminiscent of those in the artwork of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
          
        When an art critic asked Rousseau why there was a sofa in the painting, he replied that the woman was asleep on the sofa and dreaming that she had been transported to this exotic location. The painting was also accompanied by a poem whose first two lines (translated into English) stated Yadwigha in a beautiful dream / Having fallen softly to sleep.</p>

        <h2>The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope</h2>

          <figcaption>The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Although Rousseau was not considered a Fauve, the artists of Fauvism greatly admired him and took inspiration from his work, in particular his depictions of African landscapes, his bright bold colours, and his untrained, amateur technique, which they saw as reminiscent of European folk art.

        Like his other jungle scenes, The Hungry Lion features lush jungle vegetation painted using many different shades of green, among which Rousseau has painted various animals, including an owl, another bird, a panther, and an ape-shaped silhouette. The lion and the antelope were based on a stuffed exhibit at the Natural History Museum in Paris, showing a lion attacking an antelope.</p>
